## Outline

Through my final project, I wish to convey the importance and urgency of financial literacy in countries(especially younger adults and adolescents). I aim to portray the dearth 
in financial literacy in countries and what a profound impact it plays on the country's performance world wide. Since there has been a drastic change in the way money works from 
our parent's generation, relying on our parents to teach us about managing money is not the most lucrative option and hence, I would like to appeal to educate everyone on it's
importance and impact.

## Proposed Structure

I would like to start this story by something like "Would you ignore a relationship which you know will inevitably affect you?". This is aimed to gather the attention of the crowd 
after which I will spill the concept of money around it. I would like to convey to the audience that no matter what you think about money, having a good relationship with it
is of utmost importance because not having one will affect you in the future. I am to show some vizualisations talking about the financial literacy in countries, some financial 
patterns that young adults use today and explain why is it not a good advice to learn to manage money from your parents.

I then wish to showcase the importance of financial literacy by showing the patterns in countries that have done well economically and why financial literacy holds such an important
part in it. A call to action would be presented at the last that focusses on having a few compulsory courses on finance for every student in the world and also, push people 
to educate themselves about how our economy works and how to maintain a good relationship with your money.
