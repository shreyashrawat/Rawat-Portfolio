# The Final Writeup (Behind the scenes!)

The final project that has come up was not at all similar to the idea that I had in mind when I first started on it. I started with the idea of telling a story about how to make a
country rich. It included ideas like how can one work towards the foundations of the country's GDP by taking small steps like encouraging equal gender participation in the workforce
but when I pitched this idea with some wireframing, I got some really good feedback as to why a viable call to action was not possible due to different conditions and mindsets of 
people according to the country.

Then, I came up with a similar but more concrete topic which was financial literacy. I had the impression that a small cohort of people knew this area really well whereas the
majority were not much concerned about it. To find out more, I decided to pick up some datasets on financial literacy according to the various demographics and patterns. From Part I and Part II,
a lot of changes were made to the initial prototype. One was the comparision between the different income countries on one graph. I made sure to explore various graphs that can
help me visualize all the different categories on one graph. Next, I changed the color scheme under the section women and financial literacy.

I went deeper and explored different patterns and behaviors in the dataset (Ex. Credit card ownership according to GDP). I started with what the topic was and why should anyone be
concerned to exploring behaviors to highlight some major discrepencies and finally moving to a call to action. The call to action includes points that can be done on various levels.

### Audience

The audience for this presentation is literally anyone on the planet because no matter how oblivious you are towards money, you will get affected. Hence, it is better to know 
about the basic concepts that you are dealing with on a daily basis and make much more informed decisions. The call to action is however more gravitated towards educational 
institutions and companies that can impose responsible financial decision making about the citizens.

### Inspiration

The idea about financial literacy came from an advertisement that I recently saw about an experiment that was conducted on finance. The video talked about the difference in the
financial literacy between men and women. The suprising part was that the data that I picked up incurred the same conclusions as the video mentioned. The link for the advertisement has been put below.

 ### Summary
 
 The journey from the intial prototype to the final outcome was a very iterative process. Feedback from people was one of the main points that helped me recognize my biases,
 mistakes that I overlooked and gave me a third person perspective. Learning to use the tools like flourish, tableau, shorthand etc was very helpful that allowed us to explore the available options for visualizing our specific kind of data. To connect to the audience, I even tries creating a personalized story of a woman to show how inflation might affect a person even though they are very oblivious about money.
