# The Final Writeup (Behind the scenes!)

The final project that has come up was not at all similar to the idea that I had in mind when I first started on it. I started with the idea of telling a story about how to make a
country rich. It included ideas like how can one work towards the foundations of the country's GDP by taking small steps like encouraging equal gender participation in the workforce
but when I pitched this idea with some wireframing, I got some really good feedback as to why a viable call to action was not possible due to different conditions and mindsets of 
people according to the country.

Then, I came up with a similar but more concrete topic which was financial literacy. I had the impression that a small cohort of people knew this area really well whereas the
majority were not much concerned about it. To find out more, I decided to pick up some datasets on financial literacy according to the various demographics and patterns. From Part I and Part II,
a lot of changes were made to the initial prototype. One was the comparision between the different income countries on one graph. I made sure to explore various graphs that can
help me visualize all the different categories on one graph. Next, I changed the color scheme under the section women and financial literacy.

I went deeper and explored different patterns and behaviors in the dataset (Ex. Credit card ownership according to GDP). I started with what the topic was and why should anyone be
concerned to exploring behaviors to highlight some major discrepencies and finally moving to a call to action. The call to action includes points that can be done on various levels.
The audience for this presentation is literally anyone on the planet because no matter how oblivious you are towards money, you will get affected. Hence, it is better to know 
about the basic concepts that you are dealing with on a daily basis and make much more informed decisions.
