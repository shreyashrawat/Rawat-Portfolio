The above graphic shows the % of people that own debit card according to the income levels of countries. There is a clear relationship between the number of debit card owners and the 
income levels of the country. The low income countries own a considerably lower number of debit cards than the higher income countries. The same pattern is also shown in credit cards
and the amount of money spent.

ensures equal financial literacy and make people more responsible with thier money.
