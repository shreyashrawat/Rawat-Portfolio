The visualization shows that there is a direct correlation between the happiness index of a person and the economic development or GDP of the country. The fulfilment of a 
person depends on various attributes but money is for sure one of the major contributing factors towards the happiness of a person. To ensure sanity and security, one does 
need a good amount of money so that they do not need to care about the day-to-day needs like food, shelter, clothes etc. 

Better handling of money leads to more economic development which in-turn is a contributing factor to the happiness index of the country. Now, since we understand that money is an important component of our lives, let's see how can we become more responsible with it.

## Behaviors and Patterns

There are various ways to borrow money including taking credit from money lenders that are usually at a very high rate of return, taking a loan or borrowing from friends and family. A lot of people are not aware about the benefits and the usage of debit and credit cards. The convenience of these services and their legitimate interest rates are something that people stay away from because of the pre-conceived notion of a lot of paperwork and lack of trust.

The above graphic shows the % of people that own debit card according to the income levels of countries. There is a clear relationship between the number of debit card owners and the income levels of the country. The low income countries own a considerably lower number of debit cards than the higher income countries. The same pattern is also shown in credit cards and the amount of money spent. 

This helps us incur that the countries that spend more and make responsible decisions with their expenditure are economically more developed. 

## How much do people know?

A short survey was conducted that asked 3 very simple questions about compound interest, inflation and risk diversification to a sample set of around 2500 people. The responses were divided country wise and is further divided into different income levels.

The visualization shows some major companies in different income levels and their respective results according to the different questions asked. Although there is no clear pattern on the results of the survey according to the GDP of the countries, the average result is better in economically developed countries which re-instates the fact that richer countries have citizens that know more about their financial decisions and how their economy works. 

## Some demographics on the survey

### Women and Financial Literacy

To delve depper into the patterns of this survey, I tried to visualize the financial literacy of the countries based on gender and income levels of the countries. This graphic is made from another survey that was done across the world about basic financial topics that affect us in everyday lives.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/7885233"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This visualization clearly portrays the huge gap in financial literacy between men and women.
This gap is not only present in the lower income countries but also in the educated economically developed countries. It is of utmost importance to take measures that 
ensures equal financial literacy and make people more responsible with thier money.

## User Research

This part of the process required me to present my storyboard to the people, wherein I talk about my topic, the graphics that I have embedded in the visualization, connection to my story and then the proposed call to action. The feedback from people were as follows

Person 1:

I would want to see the comparative visualizations on a single graphic. The different categories of countries according to income make it a little hard to compare when I can only see one category of countries. The comparision would be much more easier if I could see all the categories of countries and take a common metric like average score or metric. 

To connect a flow for the story, it would be better to show a chain of causal correlation of attributes. For example, increased financial literacy leads to increased GDP of the country which in turn leads to increase in the happiness score of the country. 

Person 2:

The last graphic that shows the difference in the financial knowledge between men and women does not have a good color scheme. The red and green color scheme is not displaying the right story as red for female is not a good representation even if that is the main point of the story.

The story needs to be re-structured a little. For instance, start with where people are at and where do you expect them to go. A clear call to action at the last is required.

Person 3:

You can show some major numeric statistics in a clear visualization. For example, you can say that the overall financial literacy is around 55% in a big bubble to highlight the major point and make the story more clearer. 

The last dot point graph can be sorted according to the minimum or maximum value to make it more readable and easy to the eye.

You can also try to figure out the reason behind the low financial literacy in poorer countries. It can be due to lesser education overall or not giving enough importance to matters related to money. Having a clear call to action.
