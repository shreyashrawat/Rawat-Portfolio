# Rawat-Portfolio
A collection of all my works from Telling Stories With Data class in CMU

## About Me
Currently a masters student at Carnegie Mellon University, I am a man of curiosity. Understanding human behavior is at the core of my work and I wish to learn more about it everyday. I strive to be a data scientist in which data vizualisation and communication plays a major role.

## What I hope to learn
I hope to understand the factors that lead to an impactful vizualisation and the reasoning behind the same. Which attributes help to attract audience, how to tell clean and accurate stories using data. Apart from the biases that humans have towards certain kinds of charts or colors, I also wish to learn the right strategies involved in showcasing a particular kind of story.
